I’ve really missed traveling, and I hope to travel again soon with my boys. Until then, my friends are doing the traveling for me, bringing back fascinating stories about the world. One of my closest friends (who I hope reads my blog!) recently returned from Morocco and told me about a group called the Berbers. Let’s take a look at who they are.

Starting with the etymology, the word "Berbers" comes from an Arabic word, which in turn comes from the Greek word "barbar." In modern Greek, this word means a brutal person with no manners, but in ancient times it simply referred to someone who didn’t speak Greek. Interestingly, the Berbers don’t actually call themselves by this name; they refer to themselves as the Amazigh, which means "the free people."

Their language sounds both strange and familiar, and it is apparently related to the ancient Egyptian language. This hints at their ancient roots, as the Berbers have existed since around 8700 BCE. Over time, their language spread, and there were even Berber kingdoms. These kingdoms were later conquered by the Arabs in the 7th and 8th centuries. What fascinates me is that, despite being conquered, the Berbers managed to preserve their own language, unlike many other nations that fully adopted Arabic. In 2011, Tamazight, the most widely spoken Berber language, was officially recognized as a national language in Morocco.

Today, Berbers mainly live in Morocco, with smaller groups in Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania, and Mali. Historically, they were traders, and today many of them continue that tradition, working as shopkeepers and farmers. Another intriguing aspect of their identity is their relationship with art. They are known for their weaving, pottery, and jewelry-making, skills. Nowadays, tourists can find their handmade goods in the bustling markets of Morocco.

I send my love to my friend Katerina, who introduced me to this topic and shared beautiful photos from her travels in Morocco. One day, we’ll travel together. It’s a promise!
