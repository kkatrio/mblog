Lately, I've been contemplating the fact that we don't learn everything about our planet Earth at school, which seems rather peculiar. I mean, there is a vast universe about which we know almost nothing, and yet there is our blue planet, which we know so much about. I understand that there is still much more to be discovered, but the contrast is intriguing.

Kids love sharing stories about their vacations and their grandparents' origins. Consequently, every day, we locate these places on the map, pondering how we could visit them. If available, we also watch quick YouTube videos to gain further insight.

Last week, one kid shared her dream about Athens, where she went for a walk and received some presents. Another kid suggested placing a small picture of the Parthenon, which is located in Athens, on the map. Maybe he is buiding his own visual map and the real one wants to ressemble more with his inner map. 

Another interesting observation is that children, as well as people in general, tend to view things in relation to one another. Until now, they had no basis for comparing Greece to other places. Greece was huge, with plenty of beaches and sunny days. For the first time they started to think that Greece is a relatively small country in Europe, and Europe is a relatively small continent on earth. 


It’s good to know about capitals and rivers but the most interesting part is the relations you make with all this information. For example, the children were learning about Egypt—its location, its renowned landmarks, traditional cuisine, and many other fascinating aspects. When I presented them with a map of the country, they drew the Nile River and depicted people fishing, going a cruise and swimming in the river ( it could be a great way to start discuss about water pollution). 


Geography is both important and fascinating, and it should be a core subject in Greek schools. It provides a valuable means to develop an appreciation for one's own country (as most Greek kids can't imagine a summer without spending numerous days at the beach and enjoying ice cream). Additionally, it allows individuals to gain insights into areas where they may have weaknesses, as everything is relative to other countries. Geography also facilitates learning about history and the economy. So, don't be surprised if your kids start saving money for their future grand trips!
