Yesterday, I went out with a friend to an art studio to meet an artist, see his work, and chat with him about various topics. The discussion with the artist was engaging and thought-provoking, but what really stayed with me was something else.

I found myself observing my friend: not just as the person I’ve always known, but also as the person she’s becoming. As she asked the artist her questions, I could see how much she had changed. She was interested in topics she hadn’t cared about just a few years ago. She has a new passion now -- she started art school last year -- and it’s so beautiful to witness someone at the beginning of a new love.
It’s like watching a window open in her mind. But it doesn’t stop there. That window opens another, and another, and so on. It feels like an endless chain of curiosity. Maybe that’s the closest we ever get to immortality. The endless desire to learn and grow.

It’s a wonderful thing to evolve yourself, but it’s equally beautiful to watch your friends evolve over time.
