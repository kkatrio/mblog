I bought the book “A man called Ove” from a big super market. It was an easy buy because I have already read “Anxious people” and I liked the story, the unfolding of the characters and the nice rhythm the dialogs had between the protagonists.


"A man called Ove” is about an old, grumpy man and his life. There are many flashbacks in the book that cause you nostalgia and leave you with a bitter-sweet taste. The characters don’t seem very real though, and at times you feel that they don’t make any sense. Αnother protagonist of the book is love. Ove had a rough life, until he met Sonia. The writer says that Sonia was the color of his life or something like this. I like love stories, but I’m not a big fan of mellow phrases, and there are many in this book.


Overall, it’s summer time, lazy days at the beach and the book “a man called Ove” is a good choice, especially if you want to read a love story and you are not quirky with the melodrama.

Ps: "Anxious people" is funnier and had more suspense. If you ‘re between these two go for the “Anxious people”.
