Good morning, everyone!

Today, I want to share some thoughts on a historical and ongoing issue: the Northern Ireland conflict between Protestants and Catholics.
Did you know that the civil war in Ireland, often referred to as "The Troubles," was a bitter conflict between Protestants and Catholics that lasted for decades? It finally came to an end in 1998 with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. However, even today, there are still segregated schools in Northern Ireland.
For those who lived through the violent days of the 90s, this might not seem so strange. The scars of the past run deep, and communities that were once divided by intense conflict often take time to heal. But to me, it sounds quite absurd that in 2024, people still feel the need to attend different schools based on their religion, especially when both groups are Christians.
This lingering segregation in education highlights how deeply ingrained divisions can persist, even after official peace agreements.
