One morning, I woke up early, sipping my black tea with milk and enjoying my breakfast while watching a random video that popped up on my YouTube homepage. It was about Kyoto, Japan.

Have you noticed how all the famous brands look slightly different in Kyoto? Kyoto is an ancient city, the former capital of Japan, with a rich cultural heritage. It maintained its character, as it was spared from the bombings during World War II. For example, McDonald's uses its iconic yellow "M" logo, but the background is completely white in Kyoto. Starbucks, normally green and white, adopts a brown color scheme there.

Why does this happen? Kyoto has strict rules about advertising and store signage. The regulations require brands to tone down their colors, using softer shades to create a calmer atmosphere.

Interestingly, some areas in Kyoto have even stricter rules than others. So, you might find the same brand with different-colored logos in various parts of the city. In my opinion, the toned-down branding in Kyoto is much more visually appealing and calming. My advice to new entrepreneurs is to design your logo and then try adapting it to Kyoto’s rules — it’ll likely end up looking much better!
