The Olympic Games wrapped up a few weeks ago, but here's a fascinating fact about our recent Olympic history: from 1912 to 1948, painters, writers, sculptors, and musicians competed for gold, silver, and bronze medals, just like athletes. I learned this intriguing piece of history from a podcast, where they also mentioned that in some categories, only silver medals might be awarded, with no gold given at all!

What are your thoughts on this? Was it a good idea to include art in the Olympic Games, or is it too challenging to evaluate creative work in this way?
