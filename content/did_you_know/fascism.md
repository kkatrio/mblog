One night, actually very early in the morning, one of my children woke me up and struggled to fall back asleep. In such moments, I often listen to lectures by Maria Efthimiou, a Greek professor of history. 
During one lecture, she raised an intriguing question: Why did fascist regimes arise so easily in the interwar period? Why did so many people accept them?

Let’s explore this before the children wake up.

World War I marked the end of empires, giving rise to new nations like Finland and Germany. But it also left people devastated—many were impoverished, and countries like Italy and Germany faced staggering unemployment.

Leaders like Mussolini and Hitler emerged as champions of the working class. Their speeches often emphasized words such as workers, people, nation, and anti-plutocracy. For populations exhausted by war and poverty, these words were comforting. People were looking for immediate solutions, and fascism offered direct answers. Unlike democracy—which was relatively new in many countries—fascism appeared decisive and effective.

Consider the perspective of someone living in those harsh conditions, in a newly formed country. A leader promising a better life and national pride would be appealing. And in tangible ways, Hitler and Mussolini did deliver: they reduced unemployment, built highways, and promoted worker welfare. In Greece, Metaxas, inspired by Mussolini, established the Social Insurance Institute (IKA).

It’s important to note that the Germans elected Hitler, unlike other fascist leaders who took power by force. He was revered by many, almost as god. Today, it’s easy to consider this as madness. But living through it is different. In a stable society, electing someone like Hitler seems unthinkable. Imagine Denmark voting for a fascist today—it’s insane.

When we witness the rise of fascist movements, it is a sign of societal decline. Hitler’s party once had minimal support—until it didn’t.
