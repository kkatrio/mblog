### Life as a New Mom: Finding Time to Write Again
A couple of months ago, I became mom of two adorable boys. Life has changed completely. Any parent, especially those with twins, will understand how the concept of free time becomes a whole new experience. Finding personal time for things like reading a book or watching your favorite show feels like a luxury now.
Recently, I had a chat with two friends who are also moms. We discussed what we miss the most now that we have kids. It made me realize how much I missed writing on my blog. However, with so little time, I knew I couldn't dive into deep analyses of books or complex videos. So, I decided to start small and simply write every week about things that catch my attention.
Let's begin with this interesting tidbit:

### Did you know about Vichy?
I'm sure many of you know the Vichy brand. But did you know that Vichy was also the capital of France during the Third Reich? During World War II, France was divided into two parts: the occupied zone and the Vichy regime, which collaborated with the Germans.
It's a bit surreal to think that the name associated with your favorite night cream has such a significant historical background.
Goodnight and see you next week!
