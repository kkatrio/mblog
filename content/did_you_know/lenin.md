On April 16, 1917, Vladimir Lenin, the exiled leader of Bolsheviks, began his return to Russia by train—a journey shrouded in conspiracy theories. How did Lenin and his comrades manage to reach Petrograd during those turbulent times? The Germans, who controlled part of the route, should have intercepted them. Was Lenin a German spy? When asked how he managed to avoid arrest along the way, he reportedly responded with something like, “A revolutionary must do whatever it takes to achieve his goals.”

Were the Bolsheviks funded by Germany, and if so, why? Russia had already invested substantial resources—both in money and soldiers—during World War I. The country could have aligned itself with the victors of the war, yet, just before the war’s end, the Bolsheviks withdrew. Many Bolsheviks, at least the majority, had promised peace to the Russian people. Central to their ideology was the idea that the struggle for justice transcended national boundaries, and they believed the revolution had to start somewhere.

In March 1918, Russia signed a peace agreement with Germany and the other Central Powers—the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Was it an easy decision? Far from it. The peace came at a tremendous cost to Russia, which was forced to give up significant territories that were crucial for the country, including major food-producing regions and areas rich in natural resources.
After a series of challenging negotiations, Russia was ultimately forced to surrender Poland, Finland, the Baltic States, and most of Ukraine. This resulted in a loss of about one-third of its population and vast, strategically vital lands.

So, was Lenin truly a German spy? This question seems more like a clickbait headline. From my brief research, it seems more likely that the Germans assisted Lenin's return to Russia because they knew he intended to push for peace—a move that served German interests by ending Russia's involvement in the war.
