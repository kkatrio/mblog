People with ADHD have difficulties organizing their behavior so as to achieve personally desired aims. Here are five strategies that may be helpful to adults or children with ADHD. 


1. Externalizing information

Talking to yourself, - that is also a recommended strategy for therapeutic writing -help you identify, comprehend and organize your thoughts. This way, instead of thinking what needs to be done, you saying it! The fact that you saying it, it may decrease the emotional discomfort that is related to the task. 


2. Exercise 

Exercise also is very beneficial for ADHD. It helps you focus and increase the possibilities for a good night sleep. 


3. You always have a snack with you!

If you forget to eat and all of a sudden you feel hungry (and why not angry) keep with you snacks. 


4. Keep a planner

To – do lists are really useful, but sometimes you don’t know where to start. A good question that may help you is asking yourself “What would make me feel better or free me from anxiety now if that was taken out from my list?”.


5. Improve your concentration

The idea of having to spend fifteen minutes doing a task (eg reading an article) is less intimidating than the thought of having to do a task for an hour or more. If you are concentrated for fifteen minutes then go up to thirty minutes and so on.
