Does somebody need to know their IQ?
Is IQ important?
Is Intelligence important?

What is IQ: a measure of intelligence, G factor.  
Popular IQ tests: Wais (works well toward normal distribution) & Stanford-binet (works well toward extreme and low distribution).  
* Average IQ for somebody who graduates high school: 105
* Average IQ for somebody who graduates college: 115

The concept of IQ doesnâ€™t seem to linked to close to personality.  
Openness to experience/Intellectual curiosity correlates moderately to intelligence and IQ.  
BUT IQ not connected to personality.  
Afrer 130 points Wais test starts to lose a lot of accuracy.
