I am a beginner blogger and I want to share some things I learned this week. I built my blog with Hugo. To be honest I didn’t do this all by myself. Hugo, as its site says, “is one of the most popular open-source static site generators”. Although, popular doesn’t mean it’s for everyone. You must be a little tech-savvy.

So if you pick Hugo you have to write your posts in Markdown language. I recommend it: is easy, clear, gives you this feeling of controlling your text. The route I follow, so far, is this: I write my text in a text editor. I learnt some basic [markdown online](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) such as how to write the title or put bullets in my text. After saving your text, you open a terminal (I have Linux and I try lately to use terminal to save some time and because it’s fun) in the content directory, which is the place where my posts are. Then, this is optional, I give the command “git diff” to see all the changes that I made. If you also want to check your blog before going online you can give an extra command “hugo server” in order to publish your blog in your laptop. If everything is ok, you give the command “git add”. This step, as far as I  understand, is where you choose the files that you want to save to the history (history change). After that, you write “git commit -m” and a description of your changes (eg. add a quote or erase nature category). The final step is where you send your files for publishing by writing: “git push”. And that’s it. I’m sure that are more things to learn, but the basic route you follow is the above. 

It turns out that the idea of the unknown is scarier than the unknown itself. Quarantine days are a good chance for trying and learn new things. I hope that this was helpful and you feel a little bit less scared, at least in terms of markdown.
